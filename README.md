# StockTrader2.0
The python scripts were used to prototype but may differ slightly from the notebooks. 


Stock_Prediction_Project.ipynb used python 3.7 and can be run independently.

The other notebooks: Generate_Dataset_for_5min, 5min_lstm_model, and kmeans_groups_before_5min_lstm use python 3.10.
To run 5min_lstm_model or kmeans_groups_before_5min_lstm you must run Generate_Dataset_for_5min if 5minData folder is not populated.

Dependencies should all be captured in the requirements.txt
